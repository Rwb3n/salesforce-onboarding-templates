<!-- Personal productivity and communication preferences -->

**Purpose:** Document my working approach to maintain consistency and quality
**Created:** 2025-10-09
**Status:** Living document, updates as I learn L&P culture

## Communication Style

### General Approach
- Clear, concise, structured communication
- Focus on problems, solutions, and next steps
- Ask clarifying questions before assuming
- Show methodology (how I investigated, not just conclusions)
- Acknowledge uncertainty when present

### Written Communication
- Lead with key point or question
- Use bullet points for clarity
- Include context when needed
- Proofread before sending
- Professional but not overly formal

### Problem-Solving Communication
- State the problem as user experiences it
- Describe diagnostic steps taken
- Present findings with evidence
- Propose solutions with rationale
- Ask for guidance/approval before implementing

### When Seeking Guidance
- "Does this approach make sense to you?"
- "What's your preference here?"
- "How would you like me to handle X?"
- "Let me know if you'd prefer a different approach"

## Work Organization

### Task Management
- Track active work in backlog system
- Break complex tasks into manageable steps
- Prioritize based on urgency and impact
- Document decisions and outcomes
- Review weekly to stay current

### Problem-Solving Process
1. Understand the symptom (what user sees/experiences)
2. Investigate systematically (don't guess)
3. Identify root cause (not just immediate cause)
4. Consider multiple solutions (pros/cons)
5. Recommend approach with rationale
6. Test before full implementation
7. Document for future reference

### Documentation Approach
- Write as I work (not after the fact)
- Focus on "why" not just "what"
- Include enough context for others to understand
- Use templates for consistency
- Simple format > comprehensive complexity

---

## Learning Approach

### New Environment Integration
- Listen more than speak initially
- Ask clarifying questions often
- Observe team norms before proposing changes
- Learn the "why" behind existing processes
- Suggest improvements gradually, not immediately

### Technical Learning
- Learn by doing, with supervision when unfamiliar
- Document what I learn for retention
- Share knowledge learned with others
- Admit when I don't know something
- Research before asking, but ask when stuck

### Feedback Integration
- Ask for feedback on communication style
- Adjust based on team preferences
- Check in periodically: "Is this level of detail helpful?"
- Course-correct quickly when misaligned

---

## Quality Standards

### Before Sending
- Is this clear and concise?
- Have I shown my reasoning?
- Have I included enough context?
- Is my certainty level appropriate?
- Did I ask for guidance where needed?

### Before Implementing
- Do I understand the root cause?
- Have I tested this approach?
- What could go wrong? (risk assessment)
- How do I rollback if needed?
- Do I have approval if this affects others?

### Documentation Quality
- Is this useful to future me?
- Would a teammate understand this?
- Have I included examples?
- Is the format consistent?
- Can this be found when needed?

## Collaboration Preferences

### Working with Team
- Validate findings with senior team members
- Show work in progress (not just finished products)
- Credit collaborators appropriately
- Ask for second opinions on complex issues
- Offer help when capacity allows

### Working with Manager
- Seek guidance on unfamiliar territory
- Present options, not just directives
- Communicate progress proactively
- Raise blockers early
- Ask about communication preferences

### Working with Users
- Empathize with their frustration
- Explain in clear language (avoid jargon)
- Educate where possible (teach to self-serve)
- Follow up to confirm resolution
- Thank them for reporting issues

---

## Productivity Patterns

### Best Work Conditions
- Focused blocks for complex problems
- Quick responses for simple questions
- Morning for analytical work
- Afternoon for documentation
- In-office for collaboration, WFH for deep work

### Time Management
- Triage work by urgency/impact
- Batch similar tasks when possible
- Time-box investigations (set investigation limit)
- Take breaks on long problems (fresh eyes help)
- Don't work past sustainable hours

### Energy Management
- Notice when spinning wheels (take break or ask for help)
- Switch tasks when stuck (come back later)
- Celebrate small wins (maintain momentum)
- Learn from mistakes without dwelling
- Sustainable pace over heroic sprints
